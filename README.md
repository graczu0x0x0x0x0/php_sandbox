## Installation

Clone that repository wherever you want (in my example `/www/php_sandbox`)

```
$ cd /www
$ git clone git@github.com:plugowski/php_sandbox.git 
```

and load all dependencies:


```
composer update --no-dev
```

Create entry in `/etc/hosts` for example:

```
sudo echo "127.0.0.1  phpsandbox.lc" >> /etc/hosts
```

Add new `vhost` configuration in your apache:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /www/php_sandbox/webroot
    ServerName phpsandbox.lc
    <Directory "/www/php_sandbox/webroot">
        AllowOverride All
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow From All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Restart Apache, and Voila!

## Configuration

You can change blocked function list or add/change more directives for php evaluator. To do that, open `src/config.php` 
and change settings you want.

It is possible to define multiple versions of PHP which will be available from sandbox. So first please install required versions of php on your machine (MacPorts, apt-get etc):

```
sudo port install php53
sudo port install php54
sudo port install php55
sudo port install php56
sudo port install php70
```

Then update php_commands in config file:

```php
'php_commands' => [
    '5.3' => '/opt/local/bin/php53',
    '5.4' => '/opt/local/bin/php54',
    '5.5' => '/opt/local/bin/php55',
    '5.6' => '/opt/local/bin/php56',
    '7.0' => '/opt/local/bin/php70'
]
```

## Usage

Just type some code and push `Evaluate` button or use keyboard shortcut on Mac `Command+Enter` or `Ctrl+Enter` on Windows.
More shortcuts you can find [here](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts).

Changed shortcuts by me:

Windows | Mac | Action
--- | --- | ---
Ctrl-Enter | Commantd-Enter | Execute code
Ctrl-S | Command-S | Execute code
Alt-Shift-Up | Option-Shift-Up | Move lines up
Alt-Shift-Down | Option-Shift-Down | Move lines down
Ctrl-D | Command-D | Copy line
Ctrl-Shift-L | Command-Shift-L | Show sidebar
Ctrl-Shift-S | Command-Shift-S | Save Snippet
Ctrl-Shift-P | Command-Shift-P | Add Library / Package
